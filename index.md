## Overview

ColonyRepr is a package focussed on using animal tracking data from a
subsample of a study population to gain insight into population (or
colony) representativeness. Methods were initially developed for
internal use within the [SEATRACK
program](https://larsursem.github.io/ColonyRepr/seatrack.net)

## Installation

    # The development version of this package from GitHub can be installed using:
    devtools::install_github("LarsUrsem/ColonyRepr")

## Usage

In short, the functions in the package can be used to estimate total
within-colony variation in wintering site selection and how much of that
is currently captured by the individuals you’ve been able to track.
These estimates are based on individual tracking information collected
by light-level geolocators.
